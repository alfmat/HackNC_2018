# React Native Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple React Native app to play a game of tic-tac-toe.

It corresponds with a talk given by Dr. Jeff Terrell on Tuesday, October 2nd, 2018, as part of the preliminaries for the 2018 [HackNC](https://hacknc.com/) hackathon.

You can follow the steps from Dr. Terrell's talk by checking out the code at each tag from `step01` to `step10`. Here is a list of the development steps corresponding to those tags. (The tag itself points to the completion of the step.)

- [`step01`](https://gitlab.com/unc-app-lab/react-native-tutorial-tic-tac-toe/commit/22486950b53f6e02cfcbd84820751f13acf44ce2): initialize the project: run `create-react-native-app hacknc` and choose the `blank` template.
- [`step02`](https://gitlab.com/unc-app-lab/react-native-tutorial-tic-tac-toe/commit/b456423692ee24d74efe2584ab71f6c9998836e1): create a wireframe for the board: covers flexbox layout and CSS-esque styling.
- [`step03`](https://gitlab.com/unc-app-lab/react-native-tutorial-tic-tac-toe/commit/133cc63f71a64ab59c8716c6c7e2247bd9f56881): add state and render squares from the state: illustrates the basic state -> markup flow of React and React Native.
- [`step04`](https://gitlab.com/unc-app-lab/react-native-tutorial-tic-tac-toe/commit/27a6962593273f394e0e0299040bc4f3fd249cc6): handle touches on the squares: illustrates using callbacks to change the state.
- [`step05`](https://gitlab.com/unc-app-lab/react-native-tutorial-tic-tac-toe/commit/2cbfccb684c75ef1ffc9e8ed27158fb9212b7996): track whose turn it is: add another dimension to the state.
- [`step06`](https://gitlab.com/unc-app-lab/react-native-tutorial-tic-tac-toe/commit/39fbdccaca81902a5cd054351569c48bc8536cb1): display turn indicator to user.
- [`step07`](https://gitlab.com/unc-app-lab/react-native-tutorial-tic-tac-toe/commit/629449301fa79ebcff037b7860cad84ff81cdf9e): display winning message.
- [`step08`](https://gitlab.com/unc-app-lab/react-native-tutorial-tic-tac-toe/commit/2d76fc60901e3aa4982527ce94f1d45471b01717): guard against illegal moves.
- [`step09`](https://gitlab.com/unc-app-lab/react-native-tutorial-tic-tac-toe/commit/424aca144d4f51cfa55e197438040f2a9feba52f): display tie game message.
- [`step10`](https://gitlab.com/unc-app-lab/react-native-tutorial-tic-tac-toe/commit/cdb81729a79084beaff9e9e23327201e30ee2177): add 'new game' button.
