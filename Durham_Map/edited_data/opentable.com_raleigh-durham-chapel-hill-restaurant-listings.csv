You won't be happy. I saw four people turned away while we were there for that evening due to them not having a reservation. Dining takes about two hours from the time you enter till the time you leave. The food is very tasty and easy to work with. Our waiter (Ryan) was very helpful as we had never been there before and needed some guidance. The supporting wait staff was also very attentive. You can expect to pay something over a $100.00 for dinner for two plus tip.,11/3/12
