Both were excellent. The turtle soup was very rich and thicker than all most others like Brennan's in NO. IMHO the best I ever had. Escargot was surrounding a puff pastry with a great sauce. Not your trypical butter garlic or mushroom sauce. My wife raved over the cedar plank salmon. My 9oz filet mignon was ordered medium but came out well done. Also the butter topping was cold. Would have been better room temperature. The steak was still good and they offered to cook another one for me since it was overdone. I didn't feel like waiting another 10-15 minutes so I declined and they comped our dessert. It will never cease to amaze me how often ""streak restaurants"" miss steak order temperature",10/23/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore5/stroubes-seafood-and-steak,stroubes-seafood-and-steak

The food is great and I love that they include a salad with most meals...hard to find that at an upscale restaurant. The service is always a tad slower than I'd like but I'm usually not in a hurry when I go out to eat. One thing I will say is that even though the waiters do their job I feel like they are a little cold and uninterested while serving us. We don't drink so maybe they are annoyed we aren't hiking up the bill so they can get a fat tip?? That's all I can think of. Thank goodness the last time we went we didn't have the waiter from the first time...he was on the brink of being rude.
