The waiter did get my order wrong initially which was annoying but he recovered fairly well. I brought the Salmon dish and was a little disappointed with the VERY over cooked fish. Wine list was good but I think a few more Australian wines would make it even better :-),09/22/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore3/maiyas,maiyas
