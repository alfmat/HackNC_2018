Three of us had dinner, one had the grouper, one the pork hock and one the KC steak. All of the dishes were good, but the herb touches overpowered all three dinners. Mine was the rosemary in the mashed potatoes, my son's risotto and the pork hock also had too strong a taste that detracted from the real flavor. My suggestion would be to use a much lighter hand in seasoning. The menu is quite unique and the beet salad was great, as was the carrot and turnip hash.
