A little seasoning is good, but they put way to much herb which left a bad taste in my mouth. There was no soft music, just an erie silence which made conversation awkward because others dining around you heard your conversation. Their drinks were good. Their portions are small. Their chocolate mountain dessert was gross. The server was really great. We spent $95 and I walked away hungry. We won't be returning, unless for drinks. My dining partner said his bison flank steak was good, but the mashed potatoes needed flavor or gravy.",9/26/12,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore5/blue-canyon-kitchen-and-tavern-kalispell,blue-canyon-kitchen-and-tavern-kalispellThe Boat Club Restaurant,http://www.opentable.com/the-boat-club-restaurant?scpref=110&tab=2,4,"1380 Wisconsin Ave Whitefish, MT  59937 ",30,Steakhouse,$30 and under,Whitefish,http://boatclubmt.com,boatclub@lodgeatwhitefishlake.com,(406) 863-4040,5-Apr,"I booked a reservation for me and my wife's wedding anniversary. During the reservation process, I put in the comments that it was our wedding anniversary. Upon arrival, we were seated at a table next to a big window overlooking Whitefish lake. After the gal sat us at our table, she turned to my wife and said ""happy anniversary"". I thought this was an extremely nice touch, that I didn't even ask for. Through the course of the night, 4 other restaurant employees, including the busboy said ""happy anniversary"". It was a small thing for the staff to mention, however it made my wife feel very special. Not to mention that the food was excellent, most importantly the huckleberry cheesecake! We will definitely be returning to the boat club!",10/15/12,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore5/the-boat-club-restaurant,the-boat-club-restaurantRainbow Ranch Lodge,http://www.opentable.com/rainbow-ranch-lodge?scpref=110&tab=2,4.6,"42950 Gallatin Road Big Sky, MT  59716 ",14,Contemporary American,$50 and over,Big Sky,http://www.rainbowranchbigsky.com/montana_fine_dining.php,steve@rainbowranchbigsky.com,(406) 995-4132,4.6 / 5,Wonderful timeExcellent mixologistoutstanding dinner serviceIf we return to the Big Sky area we will return and we will recommend Rainbow Ranch to our friends as it was recommended to us.,10/3/12,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore5/rainbow-ranch-lodge,rainbow-ranch-lodgeRed Bird Restaurant,http://www.opentable.com/red-bird-restaurant?scpref=110&tab=2,4.6,"111 N.

My duck was quite good as was the octo and king crab salad. My wife's halibut was prepared well but the pot roast like gravy and the old potatoes left her looking for something less bland. Lastly, we thought a little dessert would take some of the disappointment away but it took over 20 minutes to get it. We like the RB and they have great food but this night didn't meet our expectations.",10/12/12,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore5/red-bird-restaurant,red-bird-restaurant
