Everything we tried was interesting, with some creative taste combinations. Prices were reasonable, and servings were surprisingly large for a tapas restaurant. The atmosphere hasn't changed since we were there -- still dark and cave-like but not uninviting. Zambra isn't quite up to CÃºrate in terms of atmosphere or food, in my opinion, but it's a reasonable alternative when CÃºrate is fully booked, as it often is. I made reservations through Open Table but, on the negative side, there are zero Open Table points for eating here",11/04/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore6/zambra-restaurant,zambra-restaurant
