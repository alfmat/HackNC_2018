We arrived at 7:00 p.m. for our reservation, were promptly seated, and didn't end up eating until after 8:00 p.m. I thought they had to go to the grocery store to buy the ingredients! Crazy wait time for food. We didn't end up leaving the restaurant until close to 9:00 p.m. after eating, waiting on wine refills, and waiting for the check. Again, we thought the waitress had to leave to run the credit card. Probably won't return because of the service.",07/18/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore3/the-funky-door,the-funky-door

The waiter offered very little in the way of California Chardonnay to go with my delicious chicken pasta with prosciutto and peas. The sommelier happened to walk by and I asked if he had a reasonably priced CA chard. He offered me a nice Piedmont selection. Had he not happened by, I wouldn't have had a nice accompaniment to my dish. The house made balsamic viniagrette was good, but the greens were nothing to write about as they were straight out of the bag with only a couple of grape tomatoes and a little chopped olive.",06/12/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore3/macaroni-joes,macaroni-joes

There really wasn't one thing that was outstanding or even excellent that stood out. Service was good for the amount of people that nearly packed the restaurant at 7 p.m., and when the JJJ is packed, its very noisy and hard to carry on a conversation. I've had better meals here, and the place seems to be succeeding on reputation, not quality or innovation.",04/17/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore3/triple-j-chophouse-and-brew-co,triple-j-chophouse-and-brew-co
