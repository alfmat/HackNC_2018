This last time the waitress was very absent, we felt neglected. She didn't offer us water, didn't refill beverages, forgot requests, didn't ask how the food was, took forever to clear our plates and bring us the check. She didn't mess up the order and did split our check for us, but overall she was really bad. The restaurant was not busy. What could have been an amazing 1 hour lunch turned into an okay two hour lunch. I will go back because of the food, but I really hope my next server is more attentive. I worked in restaurants for twelve years, so believe me - I am generally not a complainer.",10/06/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore5/town-honolulu,town-honolulu

We had a young man who was more snobbish than most of the clientele but he was tolerable and did a good job. View is and was great, though it is not a good venue for seeing the sunset. Food was outstanding. Macadamia encrusted mahi mahi is delightful.
