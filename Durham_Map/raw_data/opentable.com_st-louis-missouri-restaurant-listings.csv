All 4 of us are from different states so no one knew about good restaurants in the area. Open Table is my favorite phone AP and it helped me find the EdgeWild Restaurant and Winery in Chesterfield. What a great place! The food was spectacular. The servers were friendly and the wine tasting option was so much fun! Even the owner came to our table to make sure we were having a good time. They even ship their wine so I'm anxious to receive my two bottles and enjoy them here in Denver.",07/21/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore5/edgewild-restaurant-and-winery,edgewild-restaurant-and-winery
