We sampled 6 appetizers and all were top quality, delicious. Entrees equally good food, prepared extremely well, showcased D. Ferneau talents. Dessert course was average - we sampled all options and the creme brulees were a runny egg white texture. Waitress was very good. Decor and atmosphere are not what we prefer. Liked the ""scene"" better when it was just Ferneau.",10/20/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore5/21-twenty-one-restaurant-fka-ferneau,21-twenty-one-restaurant-fka-ferneau
