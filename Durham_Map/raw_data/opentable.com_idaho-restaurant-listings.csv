The food was great quality for a reasonable price. The service was outstanding with a friendly demeanor. They were rather knowledgeable about the menu because I had not heard of half of the entrees before. The menu doesn't seem that long but everything on it I wanted. We were seated immediately and all of our food was out rather quickly. The staff was on there A-game and I have nothing bad to say.
