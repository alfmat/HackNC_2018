It was busy with all tables full with a lot of small Japanese touches. Our waiters were friendly, attentive and helpful. They knew all the items on the menu by heart as well as all the ingredients, and did not hesitate to answer any questions we had. I was impressed that they took the time to learn how to pronounce the various japanese ingredients properly. We ordered the yellowtail sashimi with the jalapeno, the octopus sashimi, scallop and shrimp tempura, scallop with wasabi pepper, mushroom and asparagus and finally the chef's sushi dinner. It was like heaven in my mouth. It was pricey as it was Michelin star but worth every single penny.",10/08/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore5/nobu-las-vegas,nobu-las-vegas
