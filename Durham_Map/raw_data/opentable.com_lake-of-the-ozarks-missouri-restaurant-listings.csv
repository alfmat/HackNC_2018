The shaved beef sandwich was dry, as was my wifes Philly cheesesteak (she gives it a 4 out of 10). The manicotti was not good at all. Spaghetti was spaghetti. The kids meals were fine, about what you expect. marinara sauce and other red sauces had little spice and no original flare. the service was slow and it was not busy. Friday night at 830 the place was 1/4 full. It wasn't abysmal, but it wasnt good either. we will not be going back especially since there are so many decent places a stones throw from biggy's.",08/17/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore5/biggys,biggys
