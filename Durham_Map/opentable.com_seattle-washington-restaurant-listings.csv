The wonderful dinners set off a great weekend. Outstanding food, prepared expertly, and presented in a way in keeping with the homey feel of the small dining room. Penny, the chef, coupled a sense of adventure with a knowledge of what her customers will savor. Being able to watch her do her magic in the kitchen was an added benefit. We were fortunate enough to sit by the window on a night with a full moon bathing the countryside. The view, spectacular any time, came alive, rendering an unneeded assist to the great food. Meat done to perfect with sauces that added, not overpowered and vegetables done perfectly. A great experience.",09/29/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore3/the-vine,the-vine

The room we were in had five tables I think, one large one that seated six or eight and several small two-person tables. We were seated by the bay window, I thought the best seat in the room. Service was great. The food was served hot and was simple but very good. The wait staff was very attentive but not intrusive.

Unfortunately, all the dishes we ordered came out to the table at the same time, so some of them had cooled by the time we got to them. If they had come out one by one, or 2 at a time, it would have been extraordinary.
