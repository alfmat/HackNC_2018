So budget accordingly. We had appetizers, 1 drink each, sparkling water, and entrees. OK, I got caught off guard with the price. Now having gotten that off my chest, I must say that the experience over-all was excellent. Food was excellent, service was friendly and fantastic. Also, we were repeatedly treated to ""nice"" surprises all of which are a reflection of an establishment that is committed to excellence. The quality of this establishment deserves no less than 5 stars. If quality, flavor, presentation, and service are important to you, then you certainly get what you pay for. I would highly recommend. Just budget accordingly. I hope to visit again.",09/14/2012,http://www.pickgrapevine.com/wantmore5/hodo-restaurant,hodo-restaurant
